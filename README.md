# Book-Search-Engine
A Modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

Book Search Engine is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. For this demonsstration the RESTful API has been refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end
